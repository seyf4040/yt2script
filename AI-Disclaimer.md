## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical AI Disclaimer

### This Application Uses Artificial Intelligence

**The YouTube Transcription Tool relies on AI models (OpenAI Whisper and GPT) to transcribe and format video content. You must understand the following:**

### ü§ñ AI Is Not Perfect

**Artificial Intelligence systems can and do make mistakes.** This includes:

- ‚ùå **Mishearing words** - Similar sounding words may be confused
- ‚ùå **Misinterpreting context** - Sarcasm, idioms, or cultural references may be missed
- ‚ùå **Hallucinating content** - AI may occasionally generate plausible-sounding but incorrect text
- ‚ùå **Struggling with accents** - Heavy accents or dialects may reduce accuracy
- ‚ùå **Missing nuance** - Tone, emotion, and subtle meanings may be lost
- ‚ùå **Formatting errors** - Section breaks and emphasis may not match speaker intent

### üìä Accuracy Expectations

**Typical accuracy rates:**
- Clear audio, standard accent: 85-95% accuracy
- Moderate background noise: 70-85% accuracy
- Heavy accents or poor audio: 50-70% accuracy
- Technical terminology: Variable (50-90%)

**These are estimates. Your results may vary significantly.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What This Means For You

1. **DO NOT** rely solely on AI transcripts for:
   - Legal documents or proceedings
   - Medical diagnoses or prescriptions
   - Financial advice or transactions
   - Academic citations (always cite original source)
   - Safety-critical applications
   - News reporting without verification
   - Any situation where accuracy is legally or ethically critical

2. **ALWAYS verify** important information by:
   - Watching the original video
   - Cross-referencing with multiple sources
   - Having a human expert review the content
   - Comparing transcript against audio at key points

3. **BE TRANSPARENT** when using AI transcripts:
   - Disclose that content is AI-generated
   - Cite the original video source
   - Note that transcript may contain errors
   - Don't present AI output as human-verified content

## üéì Understanding AI Limitations

### How AI Transcription Works

1. **Audio Processing**: FFmpeg extracts audio from video
2. **Speech Recognition**: OpenAI Whisper converts speech to text
3. **Text Cleaning**: GPT removes filler words and adds punctuation
4. **Formatting**: GPT structures content with headings and highlights

**Each step can introduce errors.**

### Common AI Mistakes

#### 1. Homophones (Similar Sounding Words)
- "their" vs "there" vs "they're"
- "to" vs "too" vs "two"
- "affect" vs "effect"

#### 2. Proper Nouns
- Names of people, places, companies
- Brand names and product names
- Technical terms and acronyms

#### 3. Numbers and Dates
- "Fifty" vs "fifteen"
- "2015" vs "2050"
- Phone numbers, addresses, amounts

#### 4. Context-Dependent Words
- "Lead" (metal) vs "lead" (guide)
- "Live" (alive) vs "live" (in real-time)
- Idioms and expressions

#### 5. Background Noise
- Multiple speakers
- Music or sound effects
- Environmental sounds

#### 6. Accents and Dialects
- Non-native speakers
- Regional accents
- Fast or unclear speech

### Factors Affecting Accuracy

**‚úÖ Improves Accuracy:**
- Clear, high-quality audio
- Single speaker
- Standard pronunciation
- Minimal background noise
- Moderate speaking pace
- Common vocabulary

**‚ùå Reduces Accuracy:**
- Poor audio quality
- Multiple overlapping speakers
- Heavy accents or dialects
- Technical jargon
- Background noise/music
- Very fast or very slow speech
- Sarcasm or figurative language
